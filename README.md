Keep at least one real human in a single voice channel, **continuously, for 160 hours**. If that VC
empties and nobody returns within the grace period, the run is dead — permanently.

**The event**

* Duration **160 consecutive hours**, five milestones: **32h · 64h · 96h · 128h · 160h**
* Started by hand with `/hell start`, restricted to `@gamenight host` — and the VC **must** contain
  at least one valid human, or the start is refused
* Bots never count · `@clanker` is kicked on sight · AFK still counts
* **15-second grace period** when the VC empties, with a no-ping warning
* **Random alive checks** every 1–6 h: reply `Yes` in 5 minutes or get disconnected
* A **personal stat card by DM** for every contestant when the run ends
* Hosts can post **colored embeds** with `/hell broadcast` (`info`, `warning`, `error`, …) to the
  announcement channel or the VC text chat

**How the run can continue (Hell 2)**

* At **160h completed**, after the stat cards are sent, the bot posts a *“keep on Hell?”* vote with
  **Yes/No** buttons. It stays open for **10 minutes**.
* If **most votes are Yes**, a host can run `/hell resume` and the same event continues to **320h**.
* After 160h there are **no milestones** — just one final and **secret** reward at 320h.

**The bot**

* Timestamp-based and persisted in SQLite — **a restart never resets the timer**, and a short
  outage is credited back to whoever never left the VC
* **Live log stream** DM'd to the operator: joins, leaves, kicks, milestones, errors
  (`/hell logs tail` shows recent lines in-channel when DMs are off)
* **Dangerous commands need the operator's approval**: `/hell stop`, `/hell reset` and resuming a failed run with `/hell resume` only run
  after a one-time code DM'd to the operator is entered with `/hell approve`
* **`/hell pause` freezes the run** (global + per-user timers) so a bug can be fixed without the
  160h clock punishing the event; `/hell resume` continues exactly where it stopped, with the
  paused time never counted
* **All wording in one file** — [`Announcements.py`](Announcements.py) — hot-reloadable
* A **desktop control panel** (no console) and a **systemd unit** + **Docker image** for unattended hosting
* A large test suite (engine, persistence, Discord edge, GUI, deployment) — ruff + mypy clean

## Quick start

### Linux — control panel

1. Clone this folder.
2. Run **`./run_bot.sh`** — the first run creates a virtual environment and installs the
   dependencies automatically, then the **control panel** opens. Fill in the Settings tab →
   **Save settings** → **Start bot**. Requires `python3` and `python3-tk`
   (Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install python3-tk`).
3. For debugging with visible output there is **`./run_bot_console.sh`**.

### Linux — console

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env      # fill in the token, channel IDs and role IDs
python bot.py
```

### Docker

```bash
cp .env.example .env      # fill it in
docker compose up -d      # state lives in the hell-data volume
```

A systemd unit is in [`deploy/hellbot.service`](deploy/hellbot.service).

---

## The control panel

`launcher_main.py` (what `run_bot.sh` starts) is a small Tk desktop app:

| Tab | What you get |
|---|---|
| **Dashboard** | Bot state, event state, live VC headcount, next milestone, a progress bar for the 160 h, and the result of the Discord-side configuration checks. |
| **Log** | The same lines that go to `logs/hellbot.log`, colour-coded and live, with a button to open the folder. |
| **Settings** | Every `.env` value with inline help, the token masked behind a *show* toggle, validation before saving, and an atomic write so a crash can't corrupt the file. |

The bot runs on its own asyncio loop in a background thread, so the window never freezes; closing
it asks for confirmation and shuts the bot down cleanly. Errors (bad token, missing intent, no
network) appear as pop-ups and on the dashboard instead of vanishing into a console nobody sees.

---

## Discord setup checklist

1. **Developer Portal → Bot → Privileged Gateway Intents**: enable **Server Members Intent** and
   **Message Content Intent** (the latter is required so the bot can read alive-check replies — without
   it nobody can ever answer a roll call).
2. Invite the bot with these permissions:

| Permission | Why |
|---|---|
| View Channel + Connect on the target VC | to see who is inside |
| **Move Members** | to disconnect `@clanker` users |
| Send Messages / Embed Links / Read Message History in the announcement channel | announcements + editing the progress message |
| **Mention @everyone** | milestone / start / failure / completion pings |
| Manage Messages *(optional)* | lets the bot pin the live progress message |

The bot verifies all of this on startup (`hell/health.py`) and tells you exactly what is missing —
in the log, and in the launcher's Dashboard.

### Configuration

| Variable | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `DISCORD_TOKEN` | ✅ | bot token |
| `GUILD_ID` | ✅ | server ID (slash commands sync to this guild instantly) |
| `VOICE_CHANNEL_ID` | ✅ (default `1539756705997652079`) | the Hell VC |
| `ANNOUNCE_CHANNEL_ID` | ✅ | text channel for announcements + the live progress message |
| `GAMENIGHT_HOST_ROLE_ID` | ✅ | `@gamenight host` — the only role allowed to start/stop/reset |
| `CLANKER_ROLE_ID` | ✅ | `@clanker` — auto-disconnected, never earns leaderboard time |
| `HELL_ROLE_ID`, `HELLIST_ROLE_ID`, `HELL_MASTER_ROLE_ID`, `COOL_PEOPLE_ROLE_ID` | optional | only used to render real role mentions in reward messages |
| `DATABASE_PATH` | optional | default `data/hell.sqlite3` |
| `MONITOR_INTERVAL` / `PROGRESS_INTERVAL` | optional | default `1` s / `20` s |
| `STARTUP_GRACE_SECONDS` | optional | default `15` — VC reads right after boot are observed but cannot fail the event (cold-cache guard) |
| `EMPTY_VC_GRACE_SECONDS` | optional | default `15` — how long the VC may be empty before the run fails |
| `SEND_FINAL_DMS` / `DM_DELAY_SECONDS` | optional | default `true` / `1` — end-of-event stat cards |
| `LOG_DM_ENABLED` | optional | default `true` — live log stream |
| `LOG_DM_USER_ID` | optional | default `984083829767675965` (Jaime Gaming) — who receives it |
| `LOG_DM_LEVEL` | optional | default `INFO` — `DEBUG`/`INFO`/`WARNING`/`ERROR` |
| `LOG_DM_FLUSH_SECONDS` | optional | default `3` — batching interval |
| `LOG_DM_PING_LEVEL` | optional | default `ERROR` — lines at this severity or worse, plus any Discord rate limit, @-ping the operator by DM |
| `LOG_DM_PING_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` | optional | default `300` — minimum seconds between alert pings |
| `MAX_TICK_CREDIT_SECONDS` | optional | default `5` — cap on leaderboard credit per check, so downtime is never silently credited |
| `DOWNTIME_CREDIT_SECONDS` | optional | default `300` — an outage up to this long is credited back to whoever was in the VC before *and* after it |
| `HEARTBEAT_MINUTES` | optional | default `15` — proof-of-life line in the log |

> **The VC requirement is not configurable.** `/hell start` refuses to start the event while the
> target VC has no valid human in it — an empty-VC start is impossible, no matter what the `.env`
> says. This is a hard rule, not a toggle.
| `ALIVE_CHECK_ENABLED` | optional | default `true` |
| `ALIVE_CHECK_MIN_HOURS` / `ALIVE_CHECK_MAX_HOURS` | optional | default `1` / `6` — the random window |
| `ALIVE_CHECK_TIMEOUT_MINUTES` | optional | default `5` — time to answer |
| `ALIVE_CHECK_STRICT` | optional | default `false` — `true` accepts only the exact string `Yes` |
| `ALIVE_CHECK_CHANNEL_ID` | optional | where the roll call is posted; empty = the **VC's own text chat** |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | optional | default `INFO` |

> **Rewards are announcement-only.** The bot never assigns roles; it posts exactly who is eligible
> at each milestone so a human can hand them out.

> **Booleans are parsed strictly.** `true`/`yes`/`on`/`1` and `false`/`no`/`off`/`0` are accepted;
> anything else (e.g. a typo like `ture` or `flase`) fails startup with a clear error instead of
> silently disabling the feature it was meant to turn on.

## Commands

| Command | Who | What |
|---|---|---|
| `/hell start` | `@gamenight host` | Starts the event: status → `RUNNING`, records the absolute start timestamp, starts the 160 h timer, begins VC monitoring + per-user tracking, posts the start announcement. Rejected if one is already running or the VC is empty (hard requirement). |
| `/hell status` | everyone | Status, elapsed, remaining, % complete, progress bar, live VC headcount, current + next milestone, and the milestones already reached. |
| `/hell leaderboard` | everyone | Current (or frozen final) leaderboard: Top 3 on the podium, everyone else below. |
| `/hell alivecheck` | `@gamenight host` | Runs a roll call immediately instead of waiting for the random timer. |
| `/hell reloadmessages` | `@gamenight host` | Re-read `Announcements.py` so edited wording applies immediately. |
| `/hell doctor` | `@gamenight host` | Self-check: preflight results, live state, background tasks and the (redacted) configuration. |
| `/hell logs` | `@gamenight host` | Control the live log stream: `status`, `on`, `off`, `test`, `flush`, and the minimum severity. |
| `/hell mystats` | everyone | Your own stat card (time survived, rank, rewards) — handy if your DMs are closed. |
| `/hell help` | everyone | What the event is, every command, and the rules in one card. |
| `/hell user` | everyone | How long someone has spent in Hell: time, rank, share of the event, milestones claimed. |
| `/hell export` | `@gamenight host` | The leaderboard as a CSV attachment, for handing out rewards outside Discord. |
| `/hell milestones` | everyone | All five milestones, their rewards, when each was reached and how many users were eligible. |
| `/hell difficulty` | everyone / `@gamenight host` | Show the 5 difficulty tiers and current level; `action: set` (host only, `0`-`4` or `auto`) overrides it; `action: announce` (host only) posts it to the announcement channel. |
| `/hell broadcast` | `@gamenight host` | Post the host's message as a colored embed — `level: info/warning/error/…`, `target: announcements` or `vc`, no plain text outside the embed. |
| `/hell hellevents` | everyone / `@gamenight host` | View active Hell Event, rules, or trigger an event (`action: trigger`, `@gamenight host` only). |
| `/hell gamble` | everyone | Gamble your leaderboard timer (Difficulty 3+): win bonus time or risk losing personal time + 1 minute server mute. Supports optional `[hours]` bet. |
| `/hell stop` | `@gamenight host` | **Two-step, operator-approved.** The bot DMs a one-time code to the operator's DMs, then the host runs `/hell approve` with it → event marked **CANCELLED** (explicitly *not* FAILED), leaderboard frozen. |
| `/hell reset` | `@gamenight host` | **Two-step, operator-approved.** The bot DMs a one-time code to the operator's DMs, then the host runs `/hell approve` with it → all event data wiped for a fresh run. |
| `/hell approve` | `@gamenight host` | Enter the 6-character code DM'd to the operator to confirm the pending `/hell stop`, `/hell reset` or resuming a failed run. Codes expire after 5 minutes and work exactly once; a new request invalidates the previous code. |
| `/hell pause` | `@gamenight host` | **Emergency freeze.** Stops the 160h clock *and* every contestant's clock instantly — no milestones can fire, no alive check can kick, and the empty-VC grace countdown is frozen too. Nothing can fail while paused. Persisted, so a restart stays paused. |
| `/hell resume` | `@gamenight host` | Unfreezes after a pause, continues a failed run (requires operator MFA via `/hell approve`), or after a **Yes** majority in the 160h *keep on Hell?* vote, starts **Hell 2** — the same run continues to **320h**, with no milestones after 160h and only a final, secret reward. |
| `/hell restart` | operator DM only | **Restart the bot process.** Exits with code 42 so Docker/systemd/the launcher picks it up again. The event state is preserved in SQLite and recovers automatically. Only usable via DM to the bot by the operator (LOG_DM_USER_ID). |
| `/hell security` | `@gamenight host` | **Anti-cheat report.** Shows alive-check dodging, VC flapping, rate-limit spikes and monitor health. Anything suspicious also triggers an automatic alert to the operator's DMs. |
| `/hell errors` | everyone | Look up an error code (e.g. `/hell errors HEL-100`) for its full explanation, including what it means and what to do about it. |

All output is embeds. Mentions inside an embed never ping, so a milestone can list 250 eligible
users without 250 notifications — while the `@everyone` ping stays in the message content.

### Server & Direct Message (DM) Commands

- **Server commands:** Run exclusively via slash commands (`/hell <command>`).
- **Direct Message (DM) commands:** Run exclusively in Direct Messages with the `!` prefix (e.g. `!status`, `!leaderboard`, `!mystats`, `!help`, `!restart`, `!doctor`, `!hell status`, etc.). Prefix `!` commands are strictly restricted to DMs and will not run in server channels. DM commands enforce the same host/operator authorization checks.

---

## Changing what the bot says — `Announcements.py`

Every message, title, footer, reward, emoji and colour lives in one file at the root of the
project: **[`Announcements.py`](Announcements.py)**. No logic, just text.

```python
    {
        "hours": 32,
        "title": "🔥 32 HOURS SURVIVED",
        "blurb": "Welcome to Hell has reached the first milestone.",
        "flavour": "The first gate is behind you. 128 hours to go — the easy part is over.",
        "reward": "@hell (limited)",
        "short_reward": "@hell",
    },
```

It is organised in numbered sections — milestones, start, live progress, grace period, failure,
cancellation, completion, leaderboard, alive checks, stat cards, command replies, colours — and
each block lists the `{placeholders}` it accepts.

* **Edit the text between the quotes**, keep the `{placeholders}` you want, save.
* Run **`/hell reloadmessages`** (host only) and the new wording is live — no restart, no risk to a
  running 160-hour event.
* If your edit has a syntax error or a missing name, the bot **keeps the previously loaded text**
  and tells you exactly what broke (`hell/texts.py`). It never crashes on bad copy.
* An unknown `{placeholder}` degrades to the raw template and is logged, rather than killing the
  announcement it belongs to.
* `python tools/simulate.py` prints every message offline, so you can proofread before going live.

## How it works

See **[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)** for the full module map, the
invariants each layer guarantees, and the database schema.

```
Announcements.py   every message the bot sends, in one editable file
hell/              the bot: pure core (engine, timelines, grace, leaderboard…)
                   + Discord edge (monitor, embeds, announcer, commands…)
launcher/          desktop control panel (config editor, supervisor, tkinter UI)
tools/             check.sh (lint+types+tests) and simulate.py (offline dry-run)
docs/              architecture notes
```

`engine.py` and everything below it import **zero Discord code**. The monitor feeds it plain
`Observation(now, participants)` values (bots and `@clanker` already filtered out) and gets back
plain domain events (`MilestoneReached`, `EventFailed`, `EventCompleted`, `EventCancelled`) that
the announcer turns into messages. That is why the entire rulebook is unit-testable.

### Two explicit timelines

The code keeps these two clocks in separate modules on purpose — mixing them up is the classic way
this kind of bot goes wrong.

| | Module | Range | Moved by | Stopped by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Global event timeline** | [`hell/timeline.py`](hell/timeline.py) — `EventTimeline` | **0 → 160h** | nothing but the wall clock | the run ending (FAILED / COMPLETED / CANCELLED) |
| **Per-user session timeline** | [`hell/tracking.py`](hell/tracking.py) — `UserTimeTracker` | **0 → Xh** per person | that person being in the VC | that person leaving (their clock only) |

A user disconnecting, leaving, being alive-check-kicked or being removed as `@clanker` **never**
touches the global 0 → 160h progress, as long as at least one valid participant remains. Their own
0 → Xh clock simply pauses and resumes where it left off when they come back.

### The 1-second loop

1. Read the target VC members.
2. Drop bots.
3. `@clanker` → `member.move_to(None)` immediately (plus an instant `on_voice_state_update` fast
   path), and they never appear in the participant list.
4. The remaining humans are the valid participants; each one's own clock is credited for the
   observed interval.
5. `valid_human_count == 0` → the **grace period** opens (below). Only when it expires is the run
   FAILED, permanently, with the leaderboard frozen and saved.

### Empty-VC grace period ([`hell/grace.py`](hell/grace.py))

```
VC becomes empty ──► GRACE OPEN (15s) ──► somebody joins in time ──► run continues
                                     └──► nobody joins ──────────► run FAILED
```

* A warning embed goes to the progress/announcement channel **with pings explicitly disabled**
  (`AllowedMentions(everyone=False, users=False, roles=False)`) — it alerts whoever is already
  watching without waking the server.
* If a valid human joins before the deadline, a "✅ SAVED — THE RUN CONTINUES" notice is posted
  (also without pings) and the 160h clock — which never stopped — carries on.
* Nobody accrues per-user time during the window, and milestones are not triggered while the VC is
  empty (there would be nobody to claim them); a milestone that lands mid-window fires on the first
  tick with people back in.
* If the window expires the event fails **as of the moment the VC emptied**, not the moment the
  window ran out, so grace can never inflate the survived time.
* The window is persisted (`event.grace_started_ts`), so a restart mid-countdown resumes it.
* Length is `EMPTY_VC_GRACE_SECONDS` (default 15; `0` restores instant failure).

### Live log stream ([`hell/logsink.py`](hell/logsink.py))

Everything the bot logs is mirrored to the operator's DMs in real time, batched into code blocks:

```
23:57:12 • [monitor]    ➕ Alice joined the VC (3 valid human(s) inside)
23:57:14 • [monitor]    ➖ Bob left the VC (2 valid human(s) inside)
23:57:20 • [monitor]    Kicked @clanker Clank3r (555) from the VC
23:57:31 • [alivecheck] Alive check a1b2c3 started for 4 user(s); deadline in 300s
23:58:02 ⚠️ [engine]     VC is EMPTY — grace period of 15s started
23:58:17 ⚠️ [engine]     Event FAILED — VC empty since …, grace expired at …
23:58:19 ❌ [bot]        Unhandled exception in on_message
                        Traceback (most recent call last): …
```

* Recipient is `LOG_DM_USER_ID` (defaults to **984083829767675965**, Jaime Gaming).
* One pipeline: the same records go to `logs/hellbot.log`, the launcher's Log tab and the DM, so
  nothing can be visible in one place but missing in another.
* Rate-limit safe: lines are buffered and flushed every `LOG_DM_FLUSH_SECONDS` (3 s), at most three
  messages per flush; floods are summarised as `… N line(s) dropped` instead of spamming.
* **Alarm bell**: when something goes seriously wrong — a log line at `LOG_DM_PING_LEVEL` (default
  `ERROR`) or worse, or any Discord rate limit — the operator gets a DM that **@-pings them**, with
  the offending lines in a code block. Pings are throttled to one per `LOG_DM_PING_COOLDOWN_SECONDS`
  (default 5 min), so an error storm buzzes once, not once per line. The regular batched stream
  follows without mentions.
* Self-protecting: records from the stream itself are excluded, and discord.py's HTTP/gateway
  records are suppressed while the stream is posting (no feedback loops) — rate-limit warnings from
  normal operation *do* reach the stream and trigger the ping. If the operator's DMs are closed the
  stream disables itself and says so in the file log.
* Attached before the gateway connects, so startup problems (bad token, missing intent, failed
  preflight) are delivered as soon as the DM channel opens.
* `/hell logs` toggles it live, changes severity, or sends a test line.

### End-of-event stat cards ([`hell/reports.py`](hell/reports.py), [`hell/dm.py`](hell/dm.py))

When the run ends — completed, failed or cancelled — every contestant is DM'd their own card:

```
WELCOME TO HELL

128:42:15 SURVIVED

YOU WERE... TOP 3
out of 41 contestant(s)

YOU WON 2 REWARDS
• 32h — @hell (limited)
• 64h — Limited-time Verity in Find the Verities
```

The final Top 3 of a completed run get all five milestone rewards plus `@cool people :D` listed.
Delivery is resumable (every attempt is written to `dm_log`, so a restart never double-messages),
paced at one DM per second, and users with DMs closed are reported in the channel summary — they
can run `/hell mystats` to see the same card.

### The progress message

One embed, created once and **edited** every `PROGRESS_INTERVAL` seconds (20 by default) (its ID is persisted, so it keeps being edited
after a restart; if someone deletes it, it is recreated). It shows status, `73h 24m / 160h 00m`,
percentage, a `█████████░░░░░░░░░░░` bar, live headcount, current milestone, next milestone with a
live countdown, and time remaining. Identical renders are skipped, and once the event ends the
final state is written once and the loop stops editing.

### Milestones

Driven purely by the **global** timer (`now - start_ts`), never by individual user time. Each is
claimed with an `INSERT OR IGNORE` in SQLite: only the writer that actually inserted the row
announces, so a milestone can never fire twice — including if the bot restarts in the very second
it lands. The `announced` flag is only set after Discord accepts the message, so a crash in
between re-posts it on the next startup instead of losing it.

| Milestone | Reward |
|---|---|
| 32h | `@hell` — limited |
| 64h | Limited-time Verity in [Find the Verities](https://www.roblox.com/games/138268356635577/Find-the-Verities) |
| 96h | `@hell-ist` — limited |
| 128h | Music permissions for everyone, provided they are not abused |
| 160h | `@hell master` — limited |

At **160 h** the event also becomes `COMPLETED`: the timer stops (it never counts past 160 h),
leaderboard accumulation stops, the rankings are frozen and displayed, and the final Top 3 are
announced as receiving **every milestone reward + `@cool people :D`**.

### Difficulties (0 to 4)

Difficulties make the challenge harder as the event progresses, expanding at every milestone reached:

- **0 (Starter)**: 0h – 32h. Alive checks every **1–6h**. No dead checks, no gambling.
- **1 (32h Milestone)**: 32h – 64h. Alive checks every **1–5h**. No dead checks, no gambling.
- **2 (64h Milestone)**: 64h – 96h. Alive checks every **1–4h**. **Dead checks** enabled: reply `Yes` and you get **muted 1 minute** from the server.
- **3 (96h Milestone)**: 96h – 128h. Alive checks every **1–3h**. Dead checks are more frequent with **1–5 minute mutes**. **Timer gambling unlocked** (`/hell gamble [hours]` or `!gamble [hours]`): max 1h bet, max 2 bets/hr, 40% win rate (+1.5x) / loss (-1.0x bet + 1m mute).
- **4 (128h Milestone)**: 128h – 160h. Alive checks every **1–2h**. Dead checks with **5–15 minute mutes**. High-stakes gambling (max 2h bet, max 3 bets/hr, 30% win rate, 2.5x multiplier / loss -1.0x bet + 1m mute).

### Hell Events

**Hell Events** are temporary random occurrences that happen while the challenge is in the `RUNNING` status (and never when IDLE, FAILED, COMPLETED, CANCELLED, PAUSED, or during an empty-VC grace countdown). Only one Hell Event may be active at a time.

Intervals between events occur randomly between **30 minutes and 3 hours** (scaling more frequently at higher difficulty tiers). All Hell Events persist in SQLite to survive bot restarts.

1. **Double Time** (5 minutes): All valid humans in the VC receive **2× personal leaderboard time** while active. The global 160h clock is not accelerated.
2. **Blood Pact** (Instant): Everyone currently in the VC at the moment of the event receives an instant personal survival time bonus (**+5 minutes**, scaling up to +10m on Difficulty 4).
3. **Inferno** (10 minutes): Alive/Dead checks occur at a significantly accelerated frequency (every 3–6 minutes) while preserving normal response windows.
4. **Blindness** (10 minutes): Temporarily hides remaining time and upcoming milestone from the progress card (`[HIDDEN BY BLINDNESS]`) while keeping the main elapsed timer and event status visible.
5. **Hell Jackpot** (5 minutes): Temporarily increases gambling win multipliers (+1.0x bonus multiplier).

### The 160-Hour Finale

A dedicated finale system governs the final hour (`159:00:00 → 160:00:00`) of the challenge without accelerating the global timer:

- **159:00:00 (`FINAL_HOUR`)**: Activates `FINAL_HOUR` mode and broadcasts announcement: `👹 THE FINAL HOUR — 1 HOUR REMAINING — DO NOT LET HELL GO EMPTY.`
- **159:30:00 (30m remain)**: `⚠️ 30 MINUTES REMAIN` announcement.
- **159:50:00 (10m remain)**: `🚨 10 MINUTES REMAIN — HELL IS ALMOST CONQUERED.` announcement.
- **159:55:00 (5m remain)**: `🔥 5 MINUTES REMAIN` announcement.
- **159:59:00 (Final minute)**: Progress display switches into **Final Countdown mode**, updating every second with exact seconds remaining (`60` down to `1`).
- **160:00:00 (Exact completion)**: Atomic completion of 160h challenge: triggers 160h milestone, freezes all individual time, marks event `COMPLETED`, records peak VC population, sends `@everyone` completion announcement highlighting Top 3 rewards (`@cool people :D` + all milestone rewards), and DMs individual stat cards to all participants.
- **Failure safety**: If the VC empties during the Final Hour, the standard empty-VC grace countdown runs. If nobody returns before expiration, the challenge fails permanently.

### Alive checks ("roll call")

At a **random interval between 1 and 6 hours**, while the event is running, the bot posts in the
VC chat (or `ALIVE_CHECK_CHANNEL_ID`):

```
@alice @bob @carol
🚨 ARE YOU ALIVE? Say: Yes
Reply with Yes in this channel within 5 minutes or you will be disconnected from the VC.
You keep all your leaderboard time and can rejoin immediately.
```

* Everyone **currently in the VC** is pinged — bots and `@clanker` users are never included.
* Each has **5 minutes** to reply `Yes` in that channel (case-insensitive by default; set
  `ALIVE_CHECK_STRICT=true` to demand the exact string). Counted answers get a ✅ reaction.
* Whoever stays silent is **disconnected from the VC**. Their accumulated leaderboard time is
  **not** touched and they may **rejoin immediately** — tracking resumes as normal.
* A disconnect never fails the event by itself; the run only ends if the VC is left with no valid
  humans at all (e.g. literally nobody answered).
* People who join *during* a check are not required to answer; people who already left are not
  chased.
* The pending check is persisted. If the bot restarts mid-check it resumes and even reads back
  answers posted while it was offline; if the 5 minutes expired during the downtime the check is
  **cancelled** — nobody is punished for the bot being away.
* The next check time is never announced (that would defeat the point); `/hell status` only says
  that checks happen randomly every 1–6 h.

### Leaderboard

Per-user accumulated VC seconds, credited only while the event is `RUNNING`, sorted high → low,
Top 3 with 🥇🥈🥉 and the rest numbered below. Exact ties share a rank (`1, 1, 3`). Leaving and
returning continues accumulating rather than resetting. Frozen and saved on FAILED / COMPLETED /
CANCELLED.

## Edge cases (all covered by tests)

| Case | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| User joins exactly at a milestone | Included in that milestone's eligible snapshot |
| User leaves exactly at a milestone | Excluded from the snapshot |
| A bot joins the VC | Ignored everywhere; cannot keep the event alive |
| A `@clanker` joins | Disconnected immediately, no leaderboard time, cannot keep the event alive |
| Last valid participant leaves | 15 s grace window + no-ping warning; `FAILED` only if nobody returns |
| Someone rejoins with 1 s to spare | Window closes, "SAVED" notice, run continues untouched |
| VC empties repeatedly | Each empty period gets its own window; survived time is never inflated |
| Milestone lands while the VC is empty | Held back, then awarded to whoever is present when the VC recovers (or lost with the run) |
| Restart mid-grace-window | Window resumes from the persisted `grace_started_ts` |
| Event ends while some DMs are unsent | `dm_log` resumes delivery on the next start, without duplicates |
| Contestant has DMs closed | Recorded as blocked, reported in the summary, `/hell mystats` still works |
| Slow Discord API during a roll call | Kicks/announcements run off the 1-second loop, so VC monitoring never stalls |
| A milestone edited into a broken shape | Rejected with a readable reason; the previous table stays live |
| Event length edited mid-run | Refused and logged — the running clock is never reshaped |
| No internet / bad token / missing intent | Clean one-line error and a distinct exit code, full traceback in `logs/` |
| Rapid join/leave churn | 1-second sampling keeps per-user totals correct |
| Bot restarts mid-event | State reloaded from SQLite; elapsed = `now - start_ts`; nothing resets |
| Bot restarts while paused | The event comes back paused — both clocks stay frozen until `/hell resume` |
| Bot restarts around a milestone | Atomic DB claim prevents duplicates; unsent announcements are re-posted on boot |
| 160 h hits during a 10 s update | The 1 s tick clamps everything to `start_ts + 160h`; completion wins over an empty VC at the deadline |
| User leaves and returns | Totals continue accumulating |
| Identical total times | Shared rank, deterministic display order |
| 250 people in the VC at a milestone | Message split across embed fields; never exceeds Discord's limits |
| Bot offline briefly (restart, deploy, crash) | The timer keeps running, and anyone in the VC before *and* after the outage gets that time credited back — nobody loses progress for the bot's downtime |
| Bot offline for a long time | The timer still keeps running, but the unobserved window is **not** credited to anyone and is reported in the progress message |
| Alive check + restart | Check state is persisted; replies sent while offline are recovered, and an expired check is cancelled instead of kicking people |
| Alive check ignored by everyone | Everyone is disconnected, the VC empties, and a 2-minute recovery grace period starts before failure |
| Event paused during a bug | Global + per-user clocks freeze; no milestones, no roll calls, no grace expiry, no failure — pause time is never counted |
| Grace window open when paused | The countdown freezes too; on `/hell resume` it continues with the time it had left |
| Pause crosses the 160h mark | Completion waits until *effective* time reaches 160h — a paused run can never complete early |
| Someone joins mid-check | Not pinged, not required to answer, never kicked for it |
| Discord API hiccup on a message | Logged and retried on the next cycle; the event state is untouched |

Two deliberate policy calls worth knowing:

* **Downtime does not fail the event** (the bot cannot prove the VC emptied while it was blind),
  but nobody earns leaderboard time for that window, and the gap is shown in the progress/status
  output.
* If the VC is empty **in the same tick** a milestone would land, the failure wins — nobody was
  present to claim the reward.

## Development

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

./tools/check.sh          # compile + pyflakes + ruff + mypy + tests + simulations
./tools/check.sh --fast   # same, without the simulations
python -m pytest          # tests only — no Discord connection required

python tools/simulate.py              # print every message of a full 160h run, offline
python tools/simulate.py --fail-at 40 # …of a run that dies after 40 hours
```

Tooling lives in `pyproject.toml` (pytest, mypy and ruff are configured there).

**Branding.** `assets/hellbotlogo.png` is the master artwork. After changing it, run
`python tools/make_icon.py` to regenerate the window icon and the header logo.

`tools/simulate.py` drives the real engine and the real message renderers offline — the fastest way
to review wording or verify a rule change end to end. A ready-made GitHub Actions workflow (tests on Python
3.10–3.12, lint, and both simulation paths) is in `deploy/github-actions-ci.yml` — copy it to
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` to enable it.
