"""Empty-VC **grace period** — the rule that decides when a run is really dead.

The event needs at least one valid human in the target VC.  When the last one
leaves, the run is *not* killed instantly: a grace window (15 seconds by
default, `EMPTY_VC_GRACE_SECONDS`) opens.

    VC becomes empty ──► GRACE OPEN ──► somebody joins in time ──► run continues
                                   └──► nobody joins ──────────► run FAILED

While the window is open:

* a **warning is posted in the progress channel with no pings at all** — the
  point is to alert whoever is already watching, not to mass-notify the server;
* the global 0 → 160h clock keeps ticking (see :mod:`hell.timeline`) but nobody
  accrues per-user time, because nobody is there;
* milestones are not triggered — an empty VC has nobody who could claim them;
* if a valid human joins before the deadline the window closes, a recovery
  notice is posted (again without pings) and the run continues normally.

If the window expires the event fails **as of the moment the VC emptied**, not
the moment the window expired, so the grace window can never inflate the
survived time.

The window is persisted (`event.grace_started_ts`), so a restart in the middle
of one resumes it instead of forgetting it.

This module is pure logic — no Discord, no database.
