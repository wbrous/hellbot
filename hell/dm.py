"""Delivery of the end-of-event stat cards by direct message.

When a run ends (COMPLETED, FAILED or CANCELLED) every contestant on the
frozen leaderboard receives a DM with their own numbers.  Delivery is:

* **resumable** — every attempt is written to `dm_log`, so a restart halfway
  through continues where it stopped instead of double-messaging people;
* **rate-limit friendly** — one DM per `DM_DELAY_SECONDS` (default 1s), run in
  a background task so the 1-second VC monitor is never blocked;
* **failure tolerant** — users with DMs closed are recorded as `blocked` and
  reported in the channel summary; they can still use `/hell mystats`.
