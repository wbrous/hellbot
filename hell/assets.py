"""Artwork resolution for embeds.

An image in `Announcements.py` may be either an `https://` URL or a file in the
project (e.g. `assets/hell-o-meter.png`).  Local files become `attachment://`
references, and the announcer uploads them alongside the embed automatically —
so the artwork can be swapped by dropping a new file in `assets/`, with no code
change and no image hosting.
