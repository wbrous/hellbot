"""**Timeline #2 — per-user session time: 0 → Xh.**

Every human accumulates their own total of seconds spent inside the target VC
while the event is RUNNING.  These per-user clocks are completely separate from
the global 0 → 160h event timeline (:mod:`hell.timeline`):

* a user leaving only stops **their** clock — the event clock keeps running as
  long as at least one valid human remains (and, with the grace period, even
  through a short gap);
* a user rejoining resumes accumulating on top of their existing total, it
  never resets;
* being disconnected (alive check, `@clanker`, moderation) never removes time
  that was already earned;
* bots and `@clanker` users never have a clock at all — they are filtered out
  before they reach this module.

Credit is granted per observation, capped by `max_tick_credit`, so a gap in
observations (bot downtime) can never be silently handed out as VC time.
